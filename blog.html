			<h3>How Does Technology Impact Your Daily Life?</h3>
			<p>The more advanced technology becomes, the more it seems to have control over our lives. Today, the
use of technology is widely available and insistently promoted throughout our society. While technology makes
life easier for people, it also creates some problems for our society such as the decline in ordinary social
behaviors. Yet, modern societies realized the significance of intellectual technology which is a form of new
knowledge that achieves goals or solves many problems.While the smartphone revolution has made our lives easy, it has also made us lazy. Today, the whole world is at our fingertips,and thus we don’t have to work or move around like we did previously to get things done.
<br>The most important negative impacts of the use of modern technologies on society and its impact on
individual behavior are: the formation of personal beliefs, social isolation, reduction in the family ties between
the family and society members, inactivity, obesity, lack of desire to work different kinetic activities, a waste of
time in things that are not useful, increase in the rate of violence, especially in children because of watching
violent programs, high crime rate because of spreading video clips presenting all kinds of these crimes and
ways of committing them and the spread of lies and rumors causing distraction and loss of trust in such
information. Although children are interacting with technology in our day via games, e-mail, chat, the meaning of
technology from their eyes and what their understanding of technology can be is still worth dealing with.
Children’s definition of technology, which shapes life and has become indispensable, the way and according to
which means it is used, could impact the way they make effective and conscious use of technology both during
childhood and adulthood and even their professional preference.The impacts of misusing modern technologies on members of the society
and their negative influences on economic, religious and social aspect, as well as their impact on people's
behavior and the responsibility of the society in monitoring the children who are in need of attention by
everyone through the guidance of appropriate educational ways. Moreover, this research shows the need of
joining all efforts collectively in order to protect the entire society from the dangers of modern technologies and
work together to take advantage of its resources properly. This usually starts from the family and schools and
ends with the universities, mass media and the various institutions that guarantee the rights of children from all
different areas. However, this research emphasizes the fact that everyone should take his/her responsibilities
towards using these methods properly whether at home or outside.<br>The correct use of modern technologies require a comprehensive understanding to the reality of change that happens to the community. Thus, this requires concerted efforts through full
cooperation among all sectors of society, from family to government institutions, along with the presence of
useful awareness programs supervised by these institutions and pursued by the family to utilize the modern
technologies accurately in order to ensure and protect the future generations. Nowadays, people socialize with
each other using online-environments such as Facebook, MSN and phones instead of face to face interaction on
these types of communications. The nature of the human is not programmed for this type of communication yet.
People must live and work together to socialize with each others. In conclusion, it is obvious that modern
technologies can be a double-edged weapon. They have their advantages, but with many inventions, they can
completely change our lives, for better or worse. As a result, we must work for the interest of social connection
to preserve people's feelings towards each other away from the addiction to technology. Finally, this research is
simply a little effort towards doing justice to this subject and it could assist future researchers in examining this
topic with other groups and in more depth and with more relationships to the present use of modern technologies
and their impacts on societies.</p>
